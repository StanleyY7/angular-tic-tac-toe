A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using Angular.

Live link - https://tic-tac-toe-2bb80.web.app/ (hosted on firebase, also is a PWA that can be installed).

## Overview

This was just a simple hobby/practice project to solidify my understanding of Angular (in particular Angular's lifecycle hooks), experiment with different libraries and to make a web application that was different to what I have currently done before (as I have never made a game as a web application). Additionally I wanted to make a PWA to "try out" something different.
